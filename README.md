## Notes
This is running on an older version of beatbanger as the game got updated to godot 4 back in late 2023

There are two builds, SFW and NSFW. SFW removes certain part of the game so it is only a modloader and is therefore allowed on vitadb. NSFW includes the 3 levels of the story mode and the shop all which include 18+ elements
