# Beat-Banger-PsVita-
A port of the greatest game, beat banger for the ps vita



## Current Bugs/ Issues
All Ending Videos dont work due to vita godot just not supporting it, cant really be fixed


## Instructions 


### Patching Instructions

1. Hold `Win + R` together to bring up the run box and then type `steam://open/console` into the prompt to bring up the steam console

2. In the steam console, type the command "download_depot 1813430 1813432 1018289862284499489" to get the required files from the correct version of beat banger

2. Download the beat banger mod converter from [here](https://github.com/masteroga101/Beat-Banger-Vita-mod-converter) and run the exe

3. Follow the instructions on that page, cant be bothered to copy and paste them to here 


### Setup on vita

1. Create the folder  `Ux0/data/BeatBanger`

2. Inside `Ux0/data/BeatBanger` create a mods folder

3. then put all your converted mods in there and they should show up inside the game




## Notes

This is running on an older version of beatbanger as the game got updated to godot 4 back in late 2023

Legacy and Demo mods have to converted to Release via a converter, via either an older version of beat banger or a community made converter 

Video files will not playdue to from what i can see the godot vita version just not supporting them

Load times can be long due to godot 3.5 being limited to 1 core. Thankyou very much godot
