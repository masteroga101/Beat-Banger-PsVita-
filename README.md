# Beat-Banger-PsVita-
A port of the greatest game, beat banger for the ps vita

Mods can be acquired via the official beat banger discord server or from the beat banger mods website however this site is no longer up to date as a transition is in progress


## Current Bugs/ Issues
All Ending Videos dont work due to vita godot just not supporting it, cant really be fixed


## Instructions 


### Patching Instructions

Go into the steam console and type in the command "download_depot 1813430 1813432 1018289862284499489"


### Acquiring mods

Download desired mods from the links at the bottom of the page

Download the beat banger mod converter from    and run the exe

Paste in the location of one layer above all your mod folders when prompted

Once the program has finished and closed, all the mods should now have been converted so that most can now be ran on a ps vita  (a ton of file changing, scaling and compressing) 


### Setup on vita

Create the folder  `Ux0/data/BeatBanger`

Inside `Ux0/data/BeatBanger` create a mods folder

then put all your converted mods in there and they should show up inside the game




## Notes

This is running on an older version of beatbanger as the game got updated to godot 4 back in late 2023

Legacy and Demo mods have to converted to Release via a converter
